# skills

A curated collection of **agent skills** — reusable, model-invokable capabilities packaged as a directory with a `SKILL.md` file.

These skills follow [Anthropic's skill specification](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code), which is also adopted by other AI coding agents (Antigravity, Cursor, and others). The same skill directory can be consumed by any compatible agent — just point the agent at it.

## Skills index

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`hello-skill`](skills/hello-skill/) | Sanity check — prints a greeting to verify the skills loader is wired up. |
| [`write-ai-article`](skills/write-ai-article/) | Generate a Chinese-language AI technical article in the style of 宝玉 (@dotey) + Simon Willison / Karpathy / Lilian Weng / Jay Alammar / Chip Huyen. Ready to drop into a book/blog repo. |
| [`generate-article-image`](skills/generate-article-image/) | Generate article illustrations in 宝玉's style via the Gemini image API ("Nano Banana"). Pairs with `write-ai-article`. Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`. |

## Installation

To use a skill, copy or symlink its directory into your agent's skills location.

**Claude Code:**
```bash
# User-level (available across all projects)
ln -s "$PWD/skills/<skill-name>" ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>

# Project-level (current repo only)
ln -s "$PWD/skills/<skill-name>" .claude/skills/<skill-name>
```

**Other agents (Antigravity, Cursor, etc.):** follow your agent's documentation for where it loads skills from — the `SKILL.md` format is the same. If your agent expects a single root `skills/` directory, point it at this repo's `skills/` folder directly.

## Creating a new skill

```bash
./scripts/new-skill.sh my-new-skill
```

This copies the template into `skills/my-new-skill/` and prefills the frontmatter. Then edit `SKILL.md` to fit the workflow.

See [`docs/SKILL_SPEC.md`](docs/SKILL_SPEC.md) for the full authoring guide.
